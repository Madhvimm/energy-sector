    "text": "“To truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy.” – Barack Obama\nIn an era when the imperative of sustainability intersects with the dynamics of global energy markets, understanding the economic impact of the energy sector becomes crucial, and the statement by former President Barack Obama encapsulates the urgent need to transition towards a sustainable energy future, one that harmonizes economic growth, energy security, and environmental preservation. As the world grapples with the pressing challenges of climate change, energy production and consumption dynamics have emerged as a pivotal force shaping our economic landscapes.\nIn this project, I aim to delve deeper into the economic impact of different energy sources, exploring the intricate relationship between energy prices, specifically crude oil, and natural gas, and their production and shedding light on the growing role of renewable energy and its impact on traditional energy markets. Additionally, investigating the relationship between energy prices and major economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), uncovering their ripple effects, if any, in the economy.\nBy meticulously analyzing data from various sectors, including historical energy prices, electricity costs, economic indicators, and renewable energy production, this project aims to uncover valuable insights that could inform policy decisions, business strategies, and future research endeavors.\n\n\nBefore diving into the intricate details, it is essential to understand the broader landscape. This project aims to link the price dynamics of crude oil and natural gas with their effects on the economy, providing a comprehensive analysis within the global context. Understanding this bigger picture is crucial for grasping the multi-layered relationships between the energy sector and economic development.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This blueprint represents the project’s scope.\n\n\nThis visual representation will serve as a guide through the thematic explorations of the project, setting the stage for a deep dive into the complex interplay between energy dynamics and economic indicators.\n\n\n\nTo navigate the complexities of how energy prices influence the U.S. economy, this project will dissect the data through multiple lenses, each offering a unique insight into the dynamics at play. The following analytical angles will structure our exploration:\n\n\nWe will examine the historical trends and volatility in crude oil and natural gas markets. Understanding these patterns is critical in comprehending how energy costs affect the broader economy and predicting future trends.\n\n\n\nA critical angle is the relationship between energy prices and primary economic indicators, like GDP and CPI. This perspective will allow us to measure the real impact of energy market fluctuations on financial health and consumer purchasing power.\n\n\n\nAs the energy sector evolves, so too does its economic impact. We’ll assess how the increasing presence of renewable energy in the national energy portfolio influences the traditional energy market and what that means for the future economy.\n\n\n\nDifferent sectors respond to energy price changes in various ways. We’ll delve into sector-specific data, mainly focusing on how underlying energy prices shape electricity costs for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors.\n\n\n\nEnergy policies can have a profound impact on prices and market stability. We will analyze the effects of past and present energy policies on market behavior and economic outcomes, offering insights into effective policy frameworks.\nEach of these angles will be explored through rigorous data analysis, employing time series methodologies to unpack the intricate relationship between energy markets and economic performance. By examining these perspectives, we aim to build a holistic understanding of the energy-economy nexus and provide actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interplay between energy market fluctuations and economic indicators is a focal point of numerous studies, shedding light on how changes in energy prices influence economic growth, inflation, and regional development. This section integrates existing literature that provides the backdrop for our exploration of energy price impacts on the U.S. economy, with a particular focus on studies from the United States and China.\nThe report by the Congressional Budget Office titled The Economic Effects of Recent Increases in Energy Prices examines the response of the U.S. economy to significant energy price shifts from 2004 to 2006. Despite notable increases in crude oil and natural gas prices, the report finds that the overall U.S. economy exhibited resilience, with moderate impacts on GDP, employment, and inflation. This resilience is attributed to robust economic conditions, effective monetary policies, and increased economic flexibility and stability over the years. This study provides a crucial understanding of how the U.S. economy adapts to energy price fluctuations, offering a valuable perspective for our analysis. The graph below from this report illustrates U.S. spending on petroleum as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), showing that, despite fluctuations in energy prices, the overall economic impact has been moderate. However, certain periods have seen significant spikes in energy spending relative to the nation’s economic output.\n\nIn contrast, Liping Wang’s study on The impact of energy price fluctuations on regional economic development based on a panel data model focuses on China, revealing the differential regional impacts of energy price changes on economic growth. Using data from 30 provinces and employing the FMOLS co-integration estimation method, Wang’s findings indicate that energy price variations, particularly in coal, electricity, and oil, have a tangible yet varying impact on China’s regional economies. The study underscores the significance of understanding regional disparities in energy price impacts, which could provide insightful comparisons for analyzing the U.S. context in our project.\nThese studies collectively enrich our investigation, offering comparative insights and methodological approaches to understanding the nuanced relationships between energy prices and economic indicators. By drawing on these studies, our project aims to dissect the specific dynamics within the U.S. energy market and its economic ramifications, enhancing our understanding and contributing to the broader discourse on energy economics.\n\n\n\nHere are the guiding questions that will guide the research by shedding light on the multifaceted nature of the relationship between the energy sector and the economy:\n\nHow have crude oil price fluctuations correlated with changes in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\nWhat trends can be identified in natural gas prices, and how have they historically impacted the cost of electricity for various consumer sectors?\nIn periods of significant oil price changes, how has the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reacted, particularly with respect to energy-intensive goods and services?\nHow do increases in natural gas prices affect the industrial sector’s energy expenses compared to the residential and commercial sectors?\nWhat is the relationship between crude oil prices and transportation sector electricity costs, and how does this relationship affect broader transportation industry economics?\nCan we identify a lag effect between changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and subsequent adjustments in electricity pricing across different sectors?\nTo what extent do variations in crude oil and natural gas prices explain the year-to-year variability in the U.S. inflation rate?\nHow have renewable energy production trends influenced the electricity pricing strategies of utility companies in the residential sector?\nDuring times of high volatility in energy prices, how resilient has the U.S. economy been in terms of maintaining growth and managing inflation?\nWhat patterns emerge when comparing the energy prices with the economic growth cycles, and what might this imply for future economic planning and energy policy?\n\n\n\n\n[1] Wang, L.

Each panel represents a different lag, meaning the number of months between the points in the series. The plot shows data from a public water system (PWS) with the ID CA1910067.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe clusters of similarly colored points at lag 1 do indicate some level of autocorrelation in the nitrate levels. This means that the nitrate level from the previous month has some degree of influence on the current month’s level. For time series modeling, such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), this suggests that an autoregressive term would indeed be significant, meaning that the model would use previous data points to predict future ones.\nThe fact that this autocorrelation weakens at higher lags, implies that older data points have less predictive power. This would be important when determining the order of the AR term in an ARIMA model; a smaller order may be sufficient, as incorporating too many past values might not improve the model. The presence of seasonality, suggested by the clustering of the same months’ colors, might also imply that a seasonal component should be considered in the modeling process, which could lead to the use of a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model.\n\nDecomposition Plot\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal: The seasonal component reveals a clear, consistent pattern that repeats annually.
