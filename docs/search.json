    "text": "Time Series Plot\nIn this section, we delve into time series data, focusing on the energy sector’s economic impact. Time series analysis is pivotal in understanding the temporal patterns and trends within data points collected sequentially over time. By employing time series plots, we gain invaluable insights into the underlying structures of our datasets, such as trends, seasonality, and cyclical fluctuations.\nThe visualizations will present a detailed examination of several key data sets: Crude Oil Prices, Natural Gas Prices, Electricity Prices, GDP, and CPI. Each plot is designed to elucidate the temporal progression of these variables, providing a foundation for deeper analytical exploration. Through these visualizations, we aim to identify significant patterns, anomalies, and correlations within the data, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions about the economic interplay between energy prices and broader economic indicators.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series plot for crude oil showcases the historical refiner acquisition costs. Observations include a long-term upward trend, significant volatility, and notable peaks, particularly around 2008 and 2011 and 2015. The recent years exhibit a declining trend post the last peak, highlighting the dynamic nature of crude oil prices.\nTrend: Increasing over the long term with recent decline.\nSeasonality: No clear seasonality observed due to the dominant influence of geopolitical and economic factors on oil prices.\nNature of Series: The series seems to be multiplicative, given the percentage changes and volatility patterns.\n\n\n\n\nPlot Natural Gas Prices\n# Plotting with ggplot2\np_citygate_gas &lt;- ggplot(citygate_gas_prices, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() + # Add a line geometry\n  theme_minimal() + # Use a minimal theme for a cleaner look\n  labs(title = \"Natural Gas Price Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Price (USD)\")\n\n# Convert ggplot object to plotly for interactivity\nggplotly(p_citygate_gas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe natural gas price graph, reveals substantial fluctuations, a significant peaks in 2001, 2005, 2008 and around 2021, and recent volatile trends. Unlike crude oil, natural gas prices do not exhibit a clear long-term trend but return closer to the baseline after peaks.\nTrend: Fluctuating without a clear long-term direction.\nSeasonality: Less evident due to the market’s response to short-term supply and demand changes.\nNature of Series: Likely multiplicative, reflecting the proportional changes and variability in prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Average Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers” graph offers insights into the pricing trends of electricity, an essential commodity for consumers and industries alike.\nTrend: There is a upward trend showcasing long-term growth.\nSeasonality: Periodic oscillations in price could signify seasonal demand changes, driven by heating needs in winter or cooling in summer, impacting production costs and consumption patterns.\nNature of Series: Likely additive, characterized by a regular oscillations indicating seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP growth exhibits an overall upward trend with a notable dip in 2020, possibly due to economic downturns because of the pandemic. The recovery post-dip indicates economic resilience.\nTrend: Increasing with acceleration in recent decades.\nSeasonality: Not applicable for GDP as it reflects economic trends and we cant see in the graph as well.\nNature of Series: Additive, considering the steady growth pattern with occasional dips and recoveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI graph illustrates a continuous upward trend, indicative of inflation. Recent increases suggest a period of higher inflation, potentially influenced by various economic factors.\nTrend: Consistently upward, indicating inflation.\nSeasonality: Not distinctly observable, as CPI reflects broader economic price changes\nNature of Series: Additive, with a steady increase in consumer prices over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLag Plots\nLag plots are essential tools in time series analysis, offering insights into the temporal dependency within the data. By comparing data points with their previous values (lags), we can uncover patterns, trends, and potential autocorrelation in the series. Each lag in the plot helps us to visualize how past values relate to current values, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics and forecasting future trends. In this section, we explore lag plots for various key economic indicators and energy prices, providing a deeper understanding of their time-dependent structures.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots for the Cost of Crude Oil reveal a positive autocorrelation. The presence of color-coded months suggests seasonal trends, though they are not starkly evident. As lags increase, the correlation weakens, diminishing predictive power over longer time lags.\n\nPositive Autocorrelation evident across the lags, suggesting that past prices influence future prices.\nThe strength of autocorrelation decreases with higher lags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Price lag plots display a positive autocorrelation, especially evident in the initial lags. With increasing lags, the data points become more dispersed, indicating a reduction in autocorrelation strength.\n\nStrong Autocorrelation in the initial lags, indicating past prices are good predictors for the near future.\nAs the lag increases, the correlation diminishes, which is common in time series data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity price lag plots show a strong and consistent positive autocorrelation across all lags, suggesting stable and predictable price trends. The seasonal effect is visible, with certain months consistently clustering together.\n\nStrong positive auto-correlation is maintained across various lags.\nClear month-to-month price consistency suggests significant seasonality.\nThe strong correlation at higher lags implies underlying factors affecting electricity prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP’s lag plots exhibit a very strong linear relationship across all lags, reflecting the steady economic growth.\n\nPersistent growth indicates steady economic progression.\nNo distinct seasonal patterns are visible, suggesting uniform economic growth across quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI lag plots show a strong positive autocorrelation, indicating consistent inflation trends.\n\nReflects a steady inflation rate over the years.\nThe consistent distribution of quarterly colors across lags indicates an even inflation rate across all quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plots\nDecomposition plots are powerful tools in time series analysis, allowing us to dissect a series into its core components: trend, seasonality, and irregular (residual) components. This breakdown provides a clearer understanding of the underlying patterns and behaviors in the data. For instance, the trend component shows the long-term direction of the series, while the seasonal component highlights repeating patterns over fixed periods. The irregular component captures random fluctuations that are not part of the trend or seasonality. Here, we explore the decomposition plots for various key datasets, unveiling the distinct dynamics of each.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decomposition plot for the Cost of Crude Oil offers a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns.\nTrend: Shows an upward trend until 2008, with fluctuations until 2014, followed by a downward trend, illustrating the market’s long-term dynamics.\nSeasonal: Demonstrates annual seasonal patterns, highlighting how external factors influence oil prices.\nRemainder: The residuals are relatively stable around zero, suggesting a good model fit with some sporadic spikes in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decomposition plot for the Natural Gas Price offers a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns.\nTrend: Indicates a stable trend transitioning to volatility, reflecting the market’s evolving nature.\nSeasonal: Exhibits strong annual cycles, likely tied to demand changes with seasons\nRemainder: Spikes represent unexplained anomalies, possibly due to supply disruptions, especially around 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity price decomposition highlights the stable growth and seasonality in the market.\nTrend: Shows a consistent rise, pointing to factors like inflation or cost increases in production affecting prices.\nSeasonal: A clear pattern suggests predictable consumption changes, possibly due to heating and cooling needs.\nRemainder: Minimal and stable residuals with occasional unexplained fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP decomposition provides insights into economic growth patterns.\nTrend: Reflects steady economic growth with some acceleration, illustrating the economy’s long-term health.\nSeasonal: Negligible seasonality\nRemainder: Notable deviations, like the spike around 2020, could indicate economic shocks, such as the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI decomposition plot sheds light on inflation trends.\nTrend: The upward trend signifies ongoing inflation, a key economic indicator.\nSeasonal: Minimal seasonality.\nRemainder: Small residuals suggest the model captures CPI’s main trends, with occasional anomalies.\nFor all the data series examined, the decomposition plots provide a detailed confirmation of the preliminary insights highlighted in Part 1. These plots dissect the time series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components, offering a more granular perspective that reinforces our initial analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF & PACF Plots\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are crucial tools in time series analysis, helping to identify the type of model that best describes a series. The ACF plot shows the correlation of the series with its own lags, providing insights into the overall correlation structure and potential seasonality. On the other hand, the PACF plot reveals the direct effect of past values on the current value, helping to pinpoint the order of autoregressive models.\nBy examining the ACF and PACF plots, we can discern patterns that suggest the presence of autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) components in our time series models. Significant spikes in the ACF plot indicate potential AR terms, while significant spikes in the PACF plot suggest MA terms. These plots also assist in determining the stationarity of the series, a crucial aspect in time series modeling, where non-stationary data often require differencing to achieve stationarity.\nIn this section, we’ll explore the ACF and PACF plots for our datasets delving into their autocorrelation structures and deriving insights that will inform our model selection and forecasting approach.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for crude oil prices demonstrates prolonged significant autocorrelation, suggesting a non-stationary series. The gradual decline in correlation as lags increase indicates a potential long-term dependency or trend in the data.\nThe PACF plot shows significant spike at lag 1 and 2, followed by non-significant values\nThe ACF and PACF plots suggest considering an ARIMA model with ‘p’ to be 1 and 2. The slow decay in the ACF implies that differencing (d &gt; 0) may be necessary to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for natural gas prices shows a very slow decay, suggesting non-stationarity and a need for differencing.\nThe PACF plot shows a significant spike at lag 1, followed by a drop-off.\nThe ACF and PACF plots suggest considering an ARIMA model with ‘p’ to be 1 and 2. The slow decay in the ACF implies that differencing (d &gt; 0) may be necessary to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for electricity shows a strong positive autocorrelation across all the lags indicating a potential MA term and a need for differencing due to non-stationarity.\nThe PACF plot shows a significant correlations at lag 1. The choice of ‘p’ could be 1 or 2 based on the first significant spikes.\nThe consistent autocorrelation in the ACF plot suggests a potential need for a higher-order MA term or differencing, leading to an ARIMA(p,d,q) model consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for GDP shows a persistent strong autocorrelation across all lags indicates non-stationarity, suggesting that differencing may be necessary.\nThe PACF plot have a sharp cutoff after lag 1 indicating an AR(1) process, suggesting that previous values have a significant impact on current GDP.\nGiven the strong autocorrelation and the PACF cutoff, an ARIMA(1,1,0) model may be a good starting point for modeling GDP, but differencing (d &gt; 0) may be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for CPI shows a sustained high autocorrelation across lags suggests a non-stationary time series, indicative of CPI’s long memory.\nThe PACF plot have a sharp spike and a cutoff after lag 1 indicating an AR(1) process, suggesting that previous values have a significant impact on current GDP.\nThe sustained autocorrelation in the ACF plot implies that differencing might be needed. An initial ARIMA(1,1,0) model could be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDickey-Fuller Test\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  composite_crude_oil_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8866, Lag order = 8, p-value = 0.203\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  citygate_gas_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8807, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.2055\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  total_electricity_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.2818, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.459\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in tseries::adf.test(gdp_ts): p-value greater than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  gdp_ts\nDickey-Fuller = 2.5163, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.99\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  cpi_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -0.76835, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.9644\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrend VS Difference\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving Average Smoothing\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`)."
