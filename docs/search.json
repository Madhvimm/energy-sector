The points represent annual average nitrate concentrations, the red dashed line, representing a linear regression model, has been added to indicate the overall trend within the observed period.\nThis helps us identify potential patterns, trends, or anomalies in nitrate levels over the years. Notably, it’s crucial to observe how these levels fluctuate and consider external factors that might influence these changes, such as environmental regulations or significant events affecting water quality.\n\n\nTableau Dashboard\n\nInteractive County-level Nitrate Level Map\nThe Tableau dashboard below is an interactive exploration of nitrate levels across various counties in California. This map helps in providing insights into regional disparities or areas of particular concern. There is time slider feature where you can see how nitrate levels in each county have evolved from 1998 to 2011."

    "text": "To investigate the economic impact of the energy sector, this project utilizes a series of datasets focusing on crude oil and natural gas prices, electricity costs, and key economic indicators. These datasets serve as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to explore the intricate dynamics between energy market fluctuations and economic performance.\n\nCrude Oil Price Summary\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nWe will leverage this dataset to analyze how crude oil price fluctuations correlate with economic indicators such as GDP and CPI, providing insights into the broader economic implications of oil price movements.\n\n\nNatural Gas Prices\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nWe will leverage this dataset to examine the trends in natural gas prices and their impact on the economy, particularly focusing on their influence on electricity pricing and economic indicators.\n\n\nAverage Prices of Electricity to Ultimate Customers\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nWe will leverage this dataset to explore how fluctuations in energy prices affect electricity costs across different sectors, shedding light on the sector-specific economic impacts of energy price changes.\n\n\nExternal Economic Indicators\n\nGDP Data\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\nWe will leverage this dataset to find patterns and correlate them with energy and electricity price trends to assess the broader economic impacts of energy market dynamics\n\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\nWe will leverage this dataset to analyze CPI data and understand the relationship between energy prices, inflation, and the overall economic condition, offering insights into how fluctuations in the energy sector influence consumer price levels.\nBy integrating these datasets, our analysis will provide a comprehensive view of the interconnections between the energy sector’s fluctuations and the U.S. economy’s health, contributing to the broader discourse on energy economics and policy-making."
